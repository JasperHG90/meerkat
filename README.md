# Meerkat

This is an R package containing my assignments for the course 'computational inference with R' at Utrecht University.

The package currently contains:

  - An implementation of a t-test ([view code](https://github.com/JasperHG90/meerkat/blob/master/R/a2_ttest.R))
  - An implementation of a linear regression model ([view code](https://github.com/JasperHG90/meerkat/blob/master/R/a2_linearmodel.R))
  
The documentation for this package is also available as a website at [https://jasperhg90.github.io/meerkat/](https://jasperhg90.github.io/meerkat/)

Assignment 2 can be viewed [here](https://jasperhg90.github.io/meerkat/articles/assignment2.html)
